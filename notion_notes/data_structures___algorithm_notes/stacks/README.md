# STACKS


Stack operations:


| Operation | Meaning                                        | Big-O(time) |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Push      | Putting an element on the top of the stack     | O(1)        |
| Pop       | Taking off the element on the top of the stack | O(1)        |
| Peak      | Looking at the top of the array                | O(1)        |


Putting in elements into the stack will be the Reverse of the removal


Insertion = 1,2,3  → then the Removal will be 3,2,1


This is called a : LIFO Data Structure → Last in First Out (LIFO)


Stacks can be used to reverse a sequence as well! 


Stacks are good for operations and also for DFS
